# lg-fr-companion-app

This create-react-app based project is meant to help a player keep track of information while playing.

## Technologies

-   React.js with Redux
-   Express.js (Currently it just serves the front end. No endpoints or anything.)
-   PokeApi RESTful API https://pokeapi.co/ (using this wrapper: https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi-js-wrapper)

## Project Setup

In your project directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:AlexLLKong/lg-fr-companion-app.git

cd lg-fr-companion-app

npm install

cd client

npm install

```

The Express app is setup with dotenv currently but there aren't any environment variables to worry about yet.
